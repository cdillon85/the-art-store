# The Art Store

The Art Store has its origins as a team project at Fullstack Academy to build an e-commerce store using Node/Express, React and PostgreSQL/Sequelize. You can see the original source code [HERE](https://github.com/abdelshok/graceShopper) and checkout the deployed project at (https://art-minimal-store.herokuapp.com/).

My primary contributions to that project included:

1.THE SHOPPING CART
	* Creating React components to render the shopping cart.
	* Setting up a redux reducer and thunk middleware to manage the state of the cart when items are added and removed.
	* Ensuring that items in an existing users' cart persists between visits (even if they don't checkout).
	* Ensuring that items in a visitor's cart persists (even if they don't checkout).
	
2. DATABASE SEED FILE CREATION

3. LOG-IN/SIGN UP 
	* Refactoring the Log-in and Sign up components so they were accessible at all stages of the shopping experience (not just on the home page) and would redirect users back to the page they were last on after logging them in.

4. UI DESIGN & STYLING
	* I was the sole front-end designer for this project and used a combination of bootstrap, Material-UI and pure CSS.


Since then, I decided to create an offshoot project where I can continue to refine The Art Store. Here are some of the things I am currently working on:

* <s>Update Header with new styling and UX effects</s>
* <s>Create Homepage with jumbotron separate from products page</s>
* <s>Update styling of products page including adding UX effects</s>
* <s> Update styling of log-in page</s>
* Set Header to ‘fixed’ on Shop The Collection Page
* Update Log-in form functionality so existing users can log-in
* Create link to create new user from log-in page
* Update create new user form styling to match rest of site
* Update styling of shopping cart and checkout pages
* Clicking shopping cart icon in header creates pop-out draw of shopping cart
* Update text of About page
* Convert CSS to SCSS
